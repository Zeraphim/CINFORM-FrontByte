# CINFORM - FrontByte

## 💡 What we're about 💡

A simple information-driven web app that allow users to report and visualize
ongoing DRRM events in their area. CINFORM, an amalgamation of cin from the C/C++
programming language and inform expands into **"Collaborative Information"**,
our view on how collaboration between civilians and their respective local
governments is key in producing a long-term, effective, DRRM system.<br><br>
CINFORM targets at least Python 3.7.9.
